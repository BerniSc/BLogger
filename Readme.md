#BLogger
Small Project for learning/configuring and getting used to nvim and my new NVim Config. 

The Goal was to have a project that is a little bit more complex than the default "Hello World" Stuff and forces me to use some more advanced `concepts` in nvim, including managing the git-workflow, makefile auto-creation etc.
Still I wanted to have something usefull/reusable, so I decided on a small C++-Logger.

It should be a Header-Only Logger with support for:
- [ ] File-Logging
- [ ] Console-Logging
- [ ] Composite-Logging
- [ ] logging custom "Classes/Messages" 
- [ ] Ideally maintainable and easily and intuitively usable, but out of experience.... :-)
